## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Double-click** `run-speed-test.bat` to launch the menu
2. **Choose Option 1** for the web-based speed test (recommended)
3. **Choose Option 2** for PowerShell diagnostics
4. **Choose Option 3** to run both tests

## üåê International Test Servers

- **US East** (Virginia) - Amazon/Google infrastructure
- **US West** (California) - Major tech hubs
- **Europe West** (London) - UK connectivity
- **Europe Central** (Frankfurt) - German data centers
- **Asia East** (Tokyo) - Japanese servers
- **Asia Southeast** (Singapore) - Regional hub
- **Australia** (Sydney) - Oceania connectivity
- **Canada** (Toronto) - North American alternative
- **Brazil** (S√£o Paulo) - South American testing

## üìä Why This Tool?

### Problems with Traditional Speed Tests
- **ISP Manipulation**: Many ISPs prioritize traffic to popular speed test sites
- **Local Servers**: Tests often use ISP-controlled local servers
- **Cached Results**: Some tests use pre-cached data
- **Limited Scope**: Don't test true international connectivity

### Our Solution
- **Real International Servers**: Tests actual global connectivity
- **No ISP Control**: Uses independent international infrastructure
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Beyond just download/upload speeds
- **Transparent Results**: Full diagnostic information provided
- **Historical Tracking**: Save and compare results over time

## üìã Detailed Usage

### Web-Based Test
1. Open `speed-test.html` in any modern browser
2. Select your preferred test server region or use auto-select
3. Choose test type (Full/Download Only/Upload Only/Ping Only)
4. Click "Start Speed Test" or "Test All Servers"
5. View real-time results and detailed diagnostics
6. Export results using the export buttons

### PowerShell Diagnostics
```powershell
# Basic usage
.\network-diagnostics.ps1

# With CSV export
.\network-diagnostics.ps1 -ExportCSV

# Detailed traceroute analysis
.\network-diagnostics.ps1 -Detailed

# Custom output location
.\network-diagnostics.ps1 -OutputPath "C:\MyResults\network-test.txt"
```

### Command Line Parameters
- `-TestDuration`: Test duration in seconds (default: 30)
- `-OutputPath`: Custom output file path
- `-Detailed`: Include detailed traceroute hops
- `-ExportCSV`: Export results to CSV format

## üìà Understanding Results

### Speed Measurements
- **Download Speed**: Data reception rate from international servers
- **Upload Speed**: Data transmission rate to international servers
- **Ping**: Round-trip time to server (latency)
- **Jitter**: Variation in ping times (connection stability)
- **Packet Loss**: Percentage of lost network packets

### Network Quality Indicators
- **Ping < 30ms**: Excellent for gaming and video calls
- **Ping 30-100ms**: Good for most applications
- **Ping > 100ms**: May affect real-time applications
- **Jitter < 20ms**: Stable connection
- **Jitter > 50ms**: Unstable connection
- **Packet Loss 0%**: Perfect connection
- **Packet Loss > 1%**: Network quality issues

## üîß Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Execution Policy
If PowerShell scripts won't run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Web Test Issues
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Check firewall settings for HTTP/HTTPS access
- Try a different browser if issues persist
- Disable VPN/proxy for accurate results

### Performance Issues
- Close bandwidth-intensive applications
- Test during off-peak hours
- Try different server regions
- Check for background Windows updates
